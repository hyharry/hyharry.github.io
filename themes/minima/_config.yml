#description
#desc: "This is Minima, an undoubtedly simple and lightweight dark/light mode theme for Hexo. I created this from scratch using Skeleton CSS boilerplate. It only uses CSS and Vanilla JS, without using unnecessary third-party 'render-blocking' libraries! üòÅ"
desc: "I am Yi Hu (ËÉ°Á•é).I have a broad interest in Mechanics, Materials, and Numerical Methods. 
My expertise in computational methods and programming enables me to quickly address complex problems. 
However, the goal extends beyond mere modeling. The aim is to depict the real world through simulations and models, 
and then to make predictions and create designs for practical applications."
site_purpose: "This site documents my past research experiences, which can help people learn more about me.
As a humble person who is always eager to learn, I will continually post my thoughts, notes, and projects on this site. 
It is an effective way to continue absorbing new knowledge after graduation."
